# Company Snapshot V2 — Testing & Verification

## Status

This document has two purposes:

1. define the approved V2 viability benchmark before architecture commitment;
2. become the factual record of verification actually performed later.

**Do not mark a test as passed unless it was actually run and inspected.**

# 1. Phase A representative benchmark

Separate ordinary active companies from edge cases so intentional ambiguity/sparsity does not distort the main coverage metric.

## Ordinary cohort

| Input | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NVIDIA` | large public company; company-name input |
| `Stripe` | private technology company |
| `PostHog` | smaller technology company |
| `Canva` | second private active company; reduces V1-specific bias |
| `notion.so` | domain-input behavior |

## Edge cohort

| Input | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Mercury` | ambiguous name / entity-resolution risk |
| `Craigslist` | limited recent corporate activity |

Why Mercury matters: V1 encountered an apparent Mercury result that actually belonged to unrelated `shipmercury.com`. V2 must not regress into silent entity mismatch.

# 2. What to record for every run

| Measure | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| Input | exact submitted name/domain |
| Intended company | human reference target |
| Resolved company | provider/application result |
| Official domain | returned/identified domain |
| Resolution correct? | yes/no/ambiguous |
| Candidate events found | count |
| Final signals | 0–3 |
| Signal dates | dates or explicit unknown |
| Distinct events? | yes/no |
| Source URLs | exact links used/displayed |
| Sources support claims? | manually checked yes/no per signal |
| Source provenance | tied to actual provider/search result? |
| Recency | ≤90d / ≤180d / older fallback / unknown |
| Latency | end-to-end milliseconds/seconds |
| Failure classification | if applicable |
| Notes | blocked pages, ambiguity, duplicates, weak evidence, provider issue |

# 3. Phase A hard GO criteria

A provider earns production only when all applicable hard gates pass.

## 3.1 Free-path gate
- Actual account/key can execute the required workflow without paid API usage or paid keys.
- Do not attach billing merely to make the candidate pass.
- Record relevant quota/rate-limit behavior observed.

For Gemini specifically:
- verify `gemini-2.5-flash` access;
- verify Google Search grounding executes;
- verify the required Grounded Result/Search Suggestions presentation can be implemented consistently with current provider terms.

For Exa specifically:
- verify current free/no-payment eligibility against the actual account before benchmark calls;
- verify the free allowance is sufficient for benchmark + reviewer usage.

## 3.2 Clear-company resolution
**5/5 ordinary cases** must resolve to the intended company.

A wrong clear-company resolution is a hard failure.

## 3.3 Ordinary-company coverage
At least **4/5 ordinary cases** must return a usable result with:
- 2–3 sentence company description;
- exactly three useful recent signals;
- sources.

## 3.4 Source integrity
- Zero fabricated displayed URLs.
- Every displayed URL must originate from actual provider/search/grounding output.

## 3.5 Manual grounding
For every signal in every successful benchmark snapshot:
- open the linked source;
- confirm it materially supports the claim;
- record failures rather than rationalizing them.

## 3.6 Distinctness
- Exactly three separate events/signals.
- Multiple articles about one underlying event count as one signal.

## 3.7 Ambiguity safety
`Mercury` must:
- resolve with defensible identity evidence; **or**
- return clarification/ambiguity.

It must not silently choose an unrelated company.

## 3.8 Sparse-company honesty
`Craigslist` does not need to fabricate three signals to pass.

Acceptable:
- three legitimate signals if they genuinely exist; or
- an honest limited-evidence result.

Unacceptable:
- evergreen pages disguised as current events;
- unrelated entity results;
- duplicated events;
- invented activity.

## 3.9 Performance
Target:
- median ordinary-company end-to-end latency ≤20 seconds;
- no normal case routinely exceeds ~45 seconds.

Performance is a usability gate, not a reason to weaken grounding.

# 4. Immediate NO-GO triggers

Reject or stop the candidate if any of these is material/systemic:

- required workflow needs paid usage;
- model/tool unavailable to the actual account;
- clear companies resolve incorrectly;
- ordinary coverage is below 4/5;
- accepted URLs are fabricated or cannot be tied to provider results;
- source pages materially fail to support claims;
- duplicate events repeatedly survive;
- provider output cannot be rendered legally/contractually within the required product;
- response shape is too unstable for a small reliable parser;
- provider availability/rate limits make review-call reliability implausible.

If one isolated formatting defect occurs, diagnose it.

If a failure pattern is systemic, reject the architecture rather than building a large corrective framework.

# 5. Failure classifications

Use concise factual categories where helpful:

- `provider_auth`
- `provider_unavailable`
- `provider_quota`
- `provider_paid_required`
- `provider_terms_mismatch`
- `model_unavailable`
- `search_not_executed`
- `citation_missing`
- `targeting`
- `ambiguous`
- `description`
- `signal_count`
- `signal_recency`
- `signal_duplication`
- `source_support`
- `source_quality`
- `formatting`
- `latency`
- `unknown`

Do not turn classification into another complex state machine.

# 6. Later production test matrix

Before submission, test at least:

- large public company;
- private technology company;
- smaller company;
- company-name input;
- domain input;
- ambiguous name;
- malformed/empty input;
- limited recent activity;
- provider/source weakness or blocked source behavior;
- duplicate coverage of one event;
- at least one fresh company tested only after deployment.

For each, check:
- resolution;
- description accuracy;
- factual accuracy;
- recency;
- signal diversity/distinctness;
- source validity/support;
- response time;
- loading behavior;
- error/limited-evidence behavior.

# 7. Production verification checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] live URL loads
- [ ] environment variables are configured
- [ ] no secret is exposed client-side
- [ ] actual provider calls work from production
- [ ] a fresh company succeeds through the deployed app
- [ ] domain input works in production
- [ ] source links open to the intended pages
- [ ] loading state appears during real work
- [ ] limited-evidence state is honest
- [ ] error state is usable
- [ ] mobile/responsive layout is readable
- [ ] no mock/hardcoded company facts exist in production
- [ ] no paid provider dependency was introduced
